# Learnings

Append-only log of gotchas, workarounds, and best practices discovered while building bigsmall. Newest at the bottom. Each entry has a date, what happened, and the rule we take from it. When a rule becomes permanent, promote it into `CLAUDE.md` or an ADR and link back here.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
**What happened.** One or two sentences.
**Rule.** The thing to do (or not do) next time.
```

## 2026-10-06 — Fresh Windows machine has git but nothing else

**What happened.** First environment check found git 2.55 but no Node, npm, pnpm, or GitHub CLI, and no git identity configured.
**Rule.** Record the tooling check in the plan's setup checklist. After `winget` installs, restart the terminal and the desktop app's shell so PATH updates take effect.

## 2026-10-06 — Reference sites use Copyscape

**What happened.** Both inspiration sites carry Copyscape "do not copy" badges.
**Rule.** Treat them as coverage research only. Verify factors against NIST and BIPM, not against the sites. Never copy text, code, markup, or unit descriptions. Recorded as ADR 0004.

## 2026-10-06 — Bash tool commands over ~8 KB fail on this machine

**What happened.** Multi-file heredoc writes of 8 KB or more failed with "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote", pointing at arbitrary lines. Controlled tests showed the same failure for any command of about 8.7 KB, with or without heredocs or quotes, while a 7.3 KB heredoc and small commands containing apostrophes worked. The cause is the command transport on Windows, not the content.
**Rule.** Write files larger than a few KB with the Write tool. Keep Bash tool commands well under 7 KB and write one file per command.

## 2026-10-06 — pnpm 12 blocks dependency install scripts until approved

**What happened.** `pnpm add` failed with ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS for esbuild. The older `onlyBuiltDependencies` key in pnpm-workspace.yaml was ignored; `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }` worked.
**Rule.** Approve build scripts per package under `allowBuilds` in pnpm-workspace.yaml with a comment saying why. Never approve everything.

## 2026-10-06 — TypeScript 7 drops the JavaScript compiler API

**What happened.** `typescript@7.0.2` (npm `latest`) ships only the native `tsc` plus `unstable/*` APIs; `lib/typescript.js` is gone. typescript-eslint (wants <6.1) and @astrojs/check (wants ^5 || ^6) cannot load it.
**Rule.** Stay on TypeScript 6.x, the bridge release with identical semantics and a config already clean for 7, until typescript-eslint and @astrojs/check support 7. Then bump one line. Check `pnpm view <tool> peerDependencies.typescript` before upgrading. See ADR 0005.

## 2026-10-06 — ESLint 10 and the JSX accessibility plugin

**What happened.** eslint-plugin-astro 3.x requires ESLint 10; eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y 6.10.2 declares ESLint ≤ 9. A grep of the plugin found none of the context APIs ESLint 10 removed, and it runs cleanly.
**Rule.** Keep ESLint 10. The peer override lives in pnpm-workspace.yaml with its reason. Re-check when jsx-a11y publishes a new major, or move to eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y-x if the Astro plugin adopts it.

## 2026-10-06 — Interactions that must work before hydration

**What happened.** Playwright selected a theme before the React island hydrated. The native select changed, nothing happened, and React then reset it. A user on a slow phone would see the same.
**Rule.** Anything that must work instantly (theme, preferences) is plain HTML handled by the inline pre-paint script, not a React island. Tests that drive an island wait for something it renders before interacting (docs/TESTING.md).
