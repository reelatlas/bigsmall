# Learnings

Append-only log of gotchas, workarounds, and best practices discovered while building bigsmall. Newest at the bottom. Each entry has a date, what happened, and the rule we take from it. When a rule becomes permanent, promote it into `CLAUDE.md` or an ADR and link back here.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
**What happened.** One or two sentences.
**Rule.** The thing to do (or not do) next time.

## 2026-10-06 — Fresh Windows machine has git but nothing else

**What happened.** First environment check found git 2.55 but no Node, npm, pnpm, or GitHub CLI, and no git identity configured.
**Rule.** Record the tooling check in the plan's setup checklist. After `winget` installs, restart the terminal and the desktop app's shell so PATH updates take effect.

## 2026-10-06 — Reference sites use Copyscape

**What happened.** Both inspiration sites carry Copyscape "do not copy" badges.
**Rule.** Treat them as coverage research only. Verify factors against NIST and BIPM, not against the sites. Never copy text, code, markup, or unit descriptions. Recorded as ADR 0004.

## 2026-10-06 — Bash tool commands over ~8 KB fail on this machine

**What happened.** Multi-file heredoc writes of 8 KB or more failed with "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote", pointing at arbitrary lines. Controlled tests showed the same failure for any command of about 8.7 KB, with or without heredocs or quotes, while a 7.3 KB heredoc and small commands containing apostrophes worked. The cause is the command transport on Windows, not the content.
**Rule.** Write files larger than a few KB with the Write tool. Keep Bash tool commands well under 7 KB and write one file per command.

## 2026-10-06 — pnpm 12 blocks dependency install scripts until approved

**What happened.** `pnpm add` failed with ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS for esbuild. The older `onlyBuiltDependencies` key in pnpm-workspace.yaml was ignored; `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }` worked.
**Rule.** Approve build scripts per package under `allowBuilds` in pnpm-workspace.yaml with a comment saying why. Never approve everything.

## 2026-10-06 — TypeScript 7 drops the JavaScript compiler API

**What happened.** `typescript@7.0.2` (npm `latest`) ships only the native `tsc` plus `unstable/*` APIs; `lib/typescript.js` is gone. typescript-eslint (wants <6.1) and @astrojs/check (wants ^5 || ^6) cannot load it.
**Rule.** Stay on TypeScript 6.x, the bridge release with identical semantics and a config already clean for 7, until typescript-eslint and @astrojs/check support 7. Then bump one line. Check `pnpm view <tool> peerDependencies.typescript` before upgrading. See ADR 0005.

## 2026-10-06 — ESLint 10 and the JSX accessibility plugin

**What happened.** eslint-plugin-astro 3.x requires ESLint 10; eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y 6.10.2 declares ESLint ≤ 9. A grep of the plugin found none of the context APIs ESLint 10 removed, and it runs cleanly.
**Rule.** Keep ESLint 10. The peer override lives in pnpm-workspace.yaml with its reason. Re-check when jsx-a11y publishes a new major, or move to eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y-x if the Astro plugin adopts it.

## 2026-10-06 — Interactions that must work before hydration

**What happened.** Playwright selected a theme before the React island hydrated. The native select changed, nothing happened, and React then reset it. A user on a slow phone would see the same.
**Rule.** Anything that must work instantly (theme, preferences) is plain HTML handled by the inline pre-paint script, not a React island. Tests that drive an island wait for something it renders before interacting (docs/TESTING.md).

## 2026-10-06 — Claude desktop preview launcher on Windows

**What happened.** `.claude/launch.json` with backslash paths failed ("C:rogram Files"); the launcher re-escapes backslashes. pnpm's global shim is a native `pnpm.exe`, and the app's shell does not have Node on PATH.
**Rule.** In `.claude/launch.json` (gitignored, machine-specific) use forward slashes and run pnpm through Node explicitly: `C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe` with `C:/Users/<you>/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/pnpm/bin/pnpm.mjs dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4321`. Screenshots time out while the app window is hidden; verify with page text instead.

## 2026-10-06 — Backslash escapes in files written through tool calls

**What happened.** A regex written through the Write tool with `\u00A0` landed as a raw non-breaking space, which ESLint rejected as irregular whitespace. A controlled test showed the Write and Edit tools decode `\uXXXX` into the character but leave every other backslash sequence (`\\`, `\d`, `\t`) exactly as written, so a literal `\uXXXX` cannot be produced through them at all. The Bash tool decodes JSON-style escapes instead: `\\` arrives as a single backslash, so `\\u00A0` in a command lands as the six-character `\u00A0`.
**Rule.** Keep source files free of `\u` escapes. Name each special character once with `String.fromCharCode(0x00a0)` and build regexes from constants, using `[0-9]` rather than `\d`. In Bash commands, double every backslash that must survive. When ESLint reports irregular whitespace, a raw character got in; replace it with a constant.

## 2026-10-06 — Floating-point realities in the engine tests

**What happened.** Round-tripping 0.000001 °C through kelvin came back with a relative error of 2.5e-9 because adding and subtracting 273.15 loses the tiny value's low bits. Separately, asking Intl for 21 significant digits of 1/3 returned 16: a double has no more to give.
**Rule.** Judge tiny values on absolute error: the round-trip test uses `max(|expected|, 1)` as its scale. Treat 10 significant digits as the display ceiling and never promise more precision than a double holds. Golden rows that quote a published 7-digit figure carry `tolerance: PUBLISHED_7_DIGITS` so the strict default stays strict everywhere else.

## 2026-10-06 — Aliases outrank prefixes, by design

**What happened.** "kilo" ranked kilogram above kilometer. It is a registered alias (people say "5 kilos"), so it is an exact match (class 2) while kilometer only matches by prefix (class 3).
**Rule.** Add an alias only when people really type it to mean that unit, because an alias wins over every prefix match in other categories. Keep the ambiguous ones (`oz` on fluid ounce) deliberate: they stop auto-lock and surface the choice, which docs/UX-SPEC.md §5 wants.

## 2026-10-06 — React Aria cost 12 KB for two buttons

**What happened.** The first milestone 2 build measured 91.4 KB gzipped against the 90 KB budget. React Aria's press, hover, and focus machinery was bundled for a Button and a chip's remove control. Native `<button>` elements with Tailwind `hover:` and `active:` variants brought the page to 79.1 KB.
**Rule.** Measure before adopting a component library and again after each milestone (`pnpm bundle`). Native elements first; a library only for a measured need, recorded in an ADR (0006).

## 2026-10-06 — Typing before hydration is lost on a server-rendered island

**What happened.** Browser tests typed into the converter before React attached; the controlled inputs reset to empty when hydration finished. The island now marks itself with `data-hydrated` through a `useSyncExternalStore` hook, and tests wait for it.
**Rule.** Any island that takes typed input needs a ready mark for tests, and an inline listener that captures early keystrokes for users is on the milestone 3 list (docs/UX-SPEC.md §14). `useSyncExternalStore` with a server snapshot of `false` is the effect-free way to know you are on the client.

## 2026-10-06 — A browser test found a real handoff bug

**What happened.** Typing a bare unit letter into the second box made it the source, which blanked the number in the first box. Unit tests had not covered "type a unit into the derived box". The browser test for switching categories did.
**Rule.** Only a number transfers the source between boxes (docs/UX-SPEC.md §14). Keep at least one browser test per user flow in the spec; the reducer tests cover rules, the browser tests cover sequences people actually perform.

## 2026-10-06 — jsx-a11y and virtual-focus listboxes

**What happened.** `jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events` flagged the option rows, which have click handlers but no key handlers because the combobox input handles keys through `aria-activedescendant`.
**Rule.** That is the correct pattern; disable the rule on that element only, with the reason in the comment, and let the axe suite verify the result.

## 2026-10-06 — A dev server reused by Playwright can serve stale modules

**What happened.** After rewriting several components in quick succession, every converter browser test timed out on the island's ready mark while lint, types, and unit tests passed. The console showed Vite serving a transform captured mid-write ("does not provide an export named 'UnitChip'") and React keeping the old hook state when the reducer's shape changed under hot reload.
**Rule.** When browser tests fail wholesale right after a batch of rewrites, read the browser console before touching code. Restart the dev server (or touch the rewritten files) and rerun; Playwright reuses whatever is on port 4321 locally. A reducer whose state shape changes needs a full reload, not a hot one.
